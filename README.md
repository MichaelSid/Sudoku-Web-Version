The goal of this test/project was to build a simple Sinatra sudoku web app, using the Sudoku solver engine provided by [Evengy Shadchnev](https://github.com/shadchnev).

The project does not include any integration tests, only unit tests for the game itself as we did the project before learning Capybara.

## Stack

* Ruby
* Sinatra
* HTML & CSS
* ERB
* Shotgun

##To do
I could improve the front end design eventually, maybe using Bootstrap.
